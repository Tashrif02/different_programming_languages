            <p>Ruby is a popular, general-purpose programming language. You may have heard of it in connection to Ruby on Rails, one of the most popular web development frameworks in any programming language. Although much of Ruby's popularity comes from this connection, Ruby has many uses, including web scraping, static site generation, command-line tools, automation, DevOps, and data processing.</p>

            <br>
            <p>Ruby is often called a “language of careful balance.” It was released in 1995 by Yukihiro Matsumoto. Matsumoto had in-depth knowledge of multiple programming languages, including Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp. He created Ruby to combine what he thought were the best features of these programming languages.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Ruby is a very flexible programming language that allows developers to alter how the language itself works. You can add functionality to core language features or even remove them if you need. Ruby is also a highly portable, cross-platform language. Code you write on one operating system will run on Linux, Mac OSX, and Windows. It will even run in UNIX, DOS, BeOS, OS/2, and more. Ruby developers really love the language and have found many uses for it over the years.</p>
