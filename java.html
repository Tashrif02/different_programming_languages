            <p>Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers Write Once and Run Anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. Java was developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems Inc. in May 1995 and later acquired by Oracle Corporation and is widely used for developing applications for desktop, web, and mobile devices.</p>

            <br>
            <p>Java is known for its simplicity, robustness, and security features, making it a popular choice for enterprise-level applications. Java applications are compiled to byte code that can run on any Java Virtual Machine. The syntax of Java is similar to C/C++.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Java makes writing, compiling, and debugging programming easy. It helps to create reusable code and modular programs.</p>
